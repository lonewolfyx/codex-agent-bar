## Introduction

Codex Agent Bar is a lightweight macOS menu bar app for monitoring your Codex quota at a glance. It connects to the local `codex app-server`, reads the current account rate limit data, and displays the remaining quota directly in the system menu bar.

## Features

- Shows Codex quota in the macOS menu bar.
- Displays short-term and long-term quota windows, including the 5-hour and 1-week windows when available.
- Uses color-coded quota status to make low remaining usage easy to notice.
- Provides a compact popover with quota progress, reset times, last updated time, and a quit action.
- Refreshes quota data automatically every 30 seconds.
- Runs as a menu bar accessory app without appearing in the Dock.
